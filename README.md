## Tutorial Guide

### 1. Uploading Text or Pasting Text

You can input text into the application in one of two ways:

1.  **Uploading a .txt File:**
    *   Click on the "Upload .txt File" button.
    *   A dialog box will appear, allowing you to select a .txt file from your computer.
    *   Once the file is selected, its content will be automatically loaded into the text input area.
2.  **Pasting Text:**
    *   Simply click on the text area labeled "Paste your text here..." and paste the text directly.

### 2. Clearing the Text Area

To clear the text area, simply click on the "Clear" button. This will remove any text currently in the input area, allowing you to start fresh.

### 3. Extracting Requirements

Once you have entered your text, click on the "Extract Requirements" button. The application will process the text and attempt to extract both functional and non-functional requirements.

### 4. Viewing Extracted Requirements

After the extraction process is complete, the extracted requirements will be displayed below the input area. Each requirement will be listed with its type (functional or non-functional) and a brief description.

### 5. Selecting a Language

To change the language of the application:

1.  Click on the language dropdown menu located in the upper right corner of the page.
2.  Select your desired language from the list of available options (English, Brazilian Portuguese, Arabic).
3.  The application will update to reflect your language selection.
